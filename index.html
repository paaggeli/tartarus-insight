                    <p>
                        Ah, the classic 'stalling revenue' curse. It's like trying to row a boat in a sea of molasses, isn't it? 
                        Here's the secret: Stop paddling the same way. Try changing your approach—update your marketing strategy, or better yet, 
                        revisit your ideal customer profile. Who are they really? What keeps them awake at night? Align your offering to that, 
                        and watch the tide turn. If you’re not growing, maybe your growth plan is on a diet. Feed it more data, more creativity, and a pinch of risk!

                    <p>
                        Ah, marketing campaigns—like fireworks, beautiful when they work, but sometimes they fizzle out before they even take off. 
                        Here’s your riddle: Is your campaign speaking to your audience, or merely shouting at them? People don’t buy from brands, 
                        they buy from stories. Craft yours with emotion and clarity, not a list of features. And have you considered the power of micro-targeting? 
                        It’s like finding a needle in a haystack, but much, much more satisfying.

                        Ah, coin troubles—a common plight even in the golden halls of Olympus. 
                        First, cut the excess—are you pouring drachmas into tools or services that serve no purpose? 
                        Negotiate better terms with your vendors, and do not be ashamed to ask customers to pay sooner. 
                        Offer discounts for early payments if you must. Lastly, seek new revenue streams—your current 
                        ones might be trickling instead of flowing. Adapt, and let the river of gold return to your coffers.

                        Ah, the cruel irony of a ‘great product’ that goes unnoticed. It’s like being the best musician in a room full of deaf people. 
                        Here's the secret: It's not about you; it’s about them. Have you really listened to your market? 
                        What problems are they facing that your product can solve? Find the pain points, and wrap your product in a solution. 
                        Communicate it clearly. And remember, no one cares how ‘great’ you think your product is—they care about how it solves 
                        their problem.

                        Tartarus Insight is a platform designed to help struggling entrepreneurs navigate their business challenges. Guided by the Oracle—a mystical AI—you’ll receive actionable insights to overcome obstacles and ascend from stagnation.</br>
                        <b><u>However, the Oracle is not infallible. While it wields vast knowledge, it remains an AI and can make mistakes. Always use its insights thoughtfully, and double-check critical decisions.</u></b>

                    <p>
                        Tartarus Insight is free to use when connected through Ollama, as it operates locally without requiring additional fees. However, in the future, we plan to integrate other services such as OpenAI or Claude. If you choose to use these integrations, you’ll need to provide your own API keys or pay for token usage directly through our platform. Rest assured, the Oracle remains accessible—how you summon it is up to you.
