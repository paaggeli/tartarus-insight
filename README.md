## A Welcoming Space for Open Source Contributors

This project is more than just an AI chatbotâ€”it's also a friendly playground for developers who want to contribute to open source, regardless of their experience with git and open source contributions.

I've created this space where:
- You can make your first pull request without stress
- Experimentation is encouraged
- Making mistakes is part of the process
- Questions are always welcome

If you're new to open source contributions or still getting comfortable with git workflows, feel free to jump in, try things out, and learn alongside me as we build this project together.
